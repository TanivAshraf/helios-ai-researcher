Plan: Internally decompose the topic into 5 key sub-questions. 2. Search & Summarize: Internally search for information on each sub-question. 3. Synthesize Report: Weave all information into a single, coherent report with an Introduction, a section for each key question, and a Conclusion. The final output should ONLY be the report text.
